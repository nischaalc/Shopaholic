==========

![ShopaholicLogo](shopAholic!/shopAholic!/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Icon.png)

BETA
----

**Shopaholic for iOS is an app that wants to change the way you shop.** 

No one has time to travel from store to store looking for things that they need, wasting hours and maybe even days in the 
process! This is where Shopaholic comes in - all you need to do is ask. Shopaholic talks to retailers and let's you know
which stores have the items you are looking for. Ranging from laptops to clothes, you can be sure that Shopaholic will help 
you out!

*As of this version, backend functionality has not been fully implemented due to recurring errors.*

Notes
-----

* Ports to Android and Windows Phone are planned.
* This repo may be deserted - Development for iOS may switch to Swift.
* The UX is constantly being updated and refined - please feel free to message me with any suggestions!
* All code is open source - feel free to fork this repo, but do not copy the core functionality of the app! Be nice!
